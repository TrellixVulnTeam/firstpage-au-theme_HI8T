                <p>Although Google is the undisputed king when it comes to search engines, that doesn’t mean there aren’t many other valuable places to advertise. For instance, Bing also offers a huge audience consisting of 133 million people and 5 billion monthly searches. Make the most of every opportunity to reach your customers by designing and executing a productive campaign for Bing Ads. </p>
                <p>There are many advantages to developing a powerful pay-per-click (PPC) strategy away from the crowded Google SERP. With Bing offering savvy businesses less competition and lower cost-per-click compared to their competitors, don’t simply disregard the platform as an option.</p>
                <p>In fact, Bing continues to grow its market share every year, making it a great place to expand your customer base and generate sales.</p>

                <p>Many businesses stick with Google Ads just because they are familiar with developing a campaign on the platform. But with Bing Ads planned and executed in much the same way, you won’t have to waste time learning an entirely new process. This means if you have already led a productive campaign on Google, you can swiftly set up the same campaign on Bing and start producing outstanding results.</p>
              <p>Like Google, Bing Ads has a range of targeting options. Across age, gender, location, device and location, your business can look to attract and convert those who are bound to be most interested in your products and services. Meanwhile, the demographics of people using Bing skew older, which might provide a natural advantage depending on your target market.</p>

                                <p>Google Ads is one of the most popular forms of paid advertising. Google Ads gives you
                                    the ability to promote your products and services on Google, Youtube and other major
                                    platforms.</p>
                                <p>Google Ads is one of the most effective ways to boost your online traffic and sales.

                                <p>Google Ads uses a pay-per-click (PPC) model which requires you to bid for specific
                                    keywords. You’ll be competing against others in the industry with similar
